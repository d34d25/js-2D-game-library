Stacking issue: when many dynamic bodies (around 40 to 45) are stacked on top of a static body, the start to sink a bit, increasing
iterations improves this issue, this happens due to how bodies are separated, increasing the iterations makes bodies to move in 
smaller steps giving more time to the physics engine to properly separate the bodies.

Friction sudden slowdown: when an objects moves upwards on titled surface it experiences more friction than going downwards.

Friction and gravity side effect: increasing gravity makes bodies to experience more friction while decreasing gravity makes bodies to experience less friction,
an easy work around for this is to either decrease/increase gravity and decrease/increase friction as needed.
